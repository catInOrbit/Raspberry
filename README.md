It's intended as a 2.5d game. You control an energy cube and solve puzzle to proceed to the next level, the game area is constrained in a circle like format, you can interact with the puzzle element by using the cube or by zooming out of the play area(which will cause time to slow down), you can even tilt the device to change the orientation of the play area, which could leave room for more level design. I'm trying to mimic the atmosphere of the game INSIDE but that's probably not going to be 100% accurate.
